Courswork for Malloc and Free

----Variables/functions----


void malloc(size_t size)
	validation to check size == 0 --> return null
	pointer variable that is assigned to sbrk(size)
	check pointer variable can be sbrk passed
	
void free(void *pter)
	

main()
	allocate memory to numbers 1 to 5
		(malloc calls sbrk to increase heap space by 5)
	heap should have increased by a space size of 5 
----------

We need:

	- malloc function which takes in n number of bytes and returns a pointer to a block of memory of that size to which the data can be stored in
	

	- we have virtual address apce where the heap grows upwards in memory to allow dynamic memoryallocation. Stack grows downwards in memory through recursive function calls
		- we use sbrk which returns pointer to the current top of the heap and increments the heap by 'size amount' and updates the pointer to the new top of the heap
